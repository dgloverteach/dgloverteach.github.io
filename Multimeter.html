  <h1>Multimeter for Beginners</h1>
  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 1: Understanding a Multimeter</h2>
    <p>A multimeter, also known as a multi-tester or ohmmeter, is an electronic instrument used to measure different electrical quantities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 2: How to Use a Multimeter</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Connect the multimeter probes to the circuit or component you want to test.</li>
      <li><strong>Reading Voltage:</strong> Set the meter to volt readings and note the display. </li>
      <li><strong>Reading Current:</strong> Set the meter to ampere (amp) settings, and then connect it in series with the element you are testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Resistance Measurement:</strong> To measure resistance, set the multimeter to its 200 ohm setting (the exact setting may vary depending on your model).</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 3: Practical Example</h2>
    <p>For example, to check if a light bulb is working correctly, connect one probe of the multimeter to the positive terminal of the battery and another to the negative terminal.
Next, connect the third probe to one end of the light bulb and the fourth probe to the other end. Now, switch on the power source and observe the multimeter's display.</p>
